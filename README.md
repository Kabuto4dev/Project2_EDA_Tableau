# Project2_EDA_Tableau_20240516

Vanguard Test A/B analysis 

# Description
This project aims to uncover insights and trends within the dataset. The process involves performing a thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the structure, content, and relationships within the data. Following the EDA, we will create interactive visualizations using Tableau to present the findings in a clear and insightful manner.

The dataset contains multiple attributes that will allow us to explore various aspects of the data, such as distributions, correlations, hyphotesis test, and trends over time. By leveraging both EDA and Tableau, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview and detailed analysis of the dataset, making the insights accessible and understandable.

The primary objective of this project is to analyze an A/B test conducted by Vanguard to evaluate two different digital environments. Vanguard, a leading investment management company, is interested in determining which environment leads to better conversion rates. By leveraging both EDA and Tableau, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview and detailed analysis of the dataset, making the insights accessible and understandable.

The A/B test dataset contains multiple attributes that allow us to explore various aspects of the data, such as distributions, correlations, and trends over time. By comparing the two environments, we aim to answer questions such as:
- Which environment leads to higher conversion rates?
- Are there specific user behaviors or characteristics that influence conversion?
- How do different segments of users respond to each environment?

# Folder structure

The person interested in the analysis will find the following documents in the project folder:

- vanguard presentación_0515_BACKUP.twb
- vanguard-ab-test-project_concat_fnl.ipynb

The person interested in analyzing the development of the project corpus should run the various code cells in the order in which they appear in the Jupyter notebook.
Except for those indicated with the heading: "Save df data" and "Recover df" which are included only for the person who has made the technical development related to the backup of the dataframe only in case of conflict.
