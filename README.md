# Project2_EDA_Tableau_20240516

UNESCO WHL and tourism incidence

# Description
In the current project, an approach to the interrelationship of tourism on UNESCO World Heritage properties has been carried out, to serve as a starting point and reflection in an evolutionary process that will lead us to conclusions about the impact that the visits of these tourists and the new tourism paradigm would have on these properties, their potential degradation, preventive protection actions and, ultimately, to establish a procedure for local public authorities responsible for their protection and dissemination of the places where they are located.
